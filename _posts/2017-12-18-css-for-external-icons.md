Hello there,

few days back, i was looking to add an icon after every outgoing links in my website to let visitors know that link is outgoing.
it was very simple, i need to add a `css` file in my page.
<!--more-->
i thought of adding icons from [FontAwesome](//fontawesome.io).
add the following code inside your `head` tag of your `html` page
~~~html

<head>

  ...
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="path_to_/icons.css" />
</head>

~~~
here is css that i've created.
